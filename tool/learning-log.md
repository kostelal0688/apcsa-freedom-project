* Swift is a programming language created by Apple. It’s used to make apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.
    * **Safe and Fast:** Swift is designed to catch mistakes early and run apps quickly.
    * **Easy to Read**: Its code looks cleaner and simpler than older Apple languages like Objective-C.
    * **Modern Features:** Swift has tools like “optionals,” “type inference,” and “closures” that make coding easier and less error-prone.
    * **Used With SwiftUI:** Swift works with SwiftUI, a framework to build app interfaces visually, like buttons, lists, and forms.
Example of Swift Code :
```swift
// Print a greeting
let name = "Kostela"
print("Hello, \(name)!")
```
