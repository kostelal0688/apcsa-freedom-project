## Choosing a Tool & Topic
For my year-long project, I’ve chosen to create an app called Student Success using Swift. This app will help students stay organized, motivated, and supported throughout the school year. The goal is to make it easier for students to track their assignments, goals, and progress while also giving them access to helpful tips and resources that encourage good study habits and time management.

The tool I’ve chosen to use for this project is Swift, which is Apple’s programming language for building iOS apps. Swift is known for being fast, safe, and beginner-friendly, which makes it a great choice for developing mobile applications. It also integrates well with Xcode, Apple’s app development environment, which provides a user interface designer, live previews, and debugging tools that make building apps much smoother. I decided on Swift because I want to focus on developing an iOS app that can be used by students on their iPhones or iPads. Swift will allow me to design a clean, simple interface and include interactive features such as reminders, goal tracking, and progress charts. To learn more about Swift, I watched tutorials like [Learn Swift in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcsY1YPBwzQ). I also used [W3Schools Swift Guide](https://www.w3schools.io/languages/swift-tutorials/) to review syntax and practice small coding exercises. These resources helped me build a strong foundation in Swift and gave me confidence to start working on my project.

To start learning Swift, I tinkered with basic code to try simple SwiftUI projects. For example:
```swift
    // Testing variables and printing
    let name = "Kostela"
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
    
    // Practicing Swift models
    struct Task: Identifiable {
        let id = UUID()
        let title: String
    }
    
    let sample = Task(title: "Finish Homework")
    print(sample.title)
```
This helped me understand variables, printing, structs, UUIDs, and how data will work inside my app.

## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process, which focus on defining and researching. First, I defined my topic by deciding to create an app that supports student success. Then, I researched the best tools and programming languages for building mobile apps. After comparing different options, I chose Swift because it allows me to design and develop an iOS app efficiently while learning real-world programming skills.

## Skills 
While working on my Student Success app, I’ve developed several important skills, including **Consideration** and **How to Google**
### Consideration
I learned to think carefully when choosing a tool for my project. I compared different programming languages and apps, like JavaScript, Python, and Swift, and considered which one would be best for building my Student Success app. I thought about what features I needed, how easy the tool would be to use, and how it would help my app work well for students.
### How to Google 
I practiced finding helpful tutorials, guides, and examples for Swift. I learned how to use the right search words, filter results to find the most useful sources, and focus on reliable websites. This helped me save time and find exactly what I needed to plan and start building my app.
## Summary
To conclude, I’m really excited to continue working on the Swift Student Success app. My next step will be to plan the app’s layout and start building the main features, such as the task list and goal tracker. I look forward to learning more about Swift and creating an app that can truly help students stay focused, motivated, and successful.
