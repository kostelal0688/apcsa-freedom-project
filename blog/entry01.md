## Choosing a Tool & Topic
For my year-long project, I’ve chosen to create an app called Student Success using Swift. This app will help students stay organized, motivated, and supported throughout the school year. The goal is to make it easier for students to track their assignments, goals, and progress while also giving them access to helpful tips and resources that encourage good study habits and time management.

The tool I’ve chosen to use for this project is Swift, which is Apple’s programming language for building iOS apps. Swift is known for being fast, safe, and beginner-friendly, which makes it a great choice for developing mobile applications. It also integrates well with Xcode, Apple’s app development environment, which provides a user interface designer, live previews, and debugging tools that make building apps much smoother. I decided on Swift because I want to focus on developing an iOS app that can be used by students on their iPhones or iPads. Swift will allow me to design a clean, simple interface and include interactive features such as reminders, goal tracking, and progress charts.

To learn more about Swift, I watched tutorials like [Learn Swift in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcsY1YPBwzQ). I also used [W3Schools Swift Guide](https://www.w3schools.io/languages/swift-tutorials/) to review syntax and practice small coding exercises. These resources helped me build a strong foundation in Swift and gave me confidence to start working on my project.
